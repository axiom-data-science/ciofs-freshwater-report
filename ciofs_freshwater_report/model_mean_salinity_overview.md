# Monthly Mean Salinity

Plots of monthly mean surface salinity are shown in this section. 

Differences between the USGS river-forced CIOFS model (left) and the watershed model-forced CIOFS model (right) are stark in both winter and summer. The differences are less widespread in the winter ({numref}`Fig.  {number}<mean-salinity-2014-02>`) as compared with the summer ({numref}`Fig.  {number}<mean-salinity-2014-08>`).
